# Readme Template
## Better Project Organization

### Introduction

Yo Dawg, I heard you liked well documented projects so I made a better README template and then created a README for that template so you could read a README will you read about READMEs.

### Dependencies

You're gonna want a keyboard and a monitor to use this.

### Local Development Setup

Bust out your favorite text editor, this is gonna get pretty wild.

### Configuration Variables

You can place the template in different projects and you'll be inspired to fill it in with different information. It's a really cool feature, I'm very excited about it.

### Deploy

1. Clone the repo and copy the template into another project.
2. ???
3. Profit!
